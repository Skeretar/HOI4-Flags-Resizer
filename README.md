## Usage
To use the program properly, you'll have to:
	1) Insert the flags in the flags folder with its proper name (that follows the TAG_ideology scheme).
	/!\ It is reccomended to put the image size on 82x52 to avoid unpredictable behavior.

	3) Done

## Contributing
This program is still in Work in Progress, so it's reccomended to open issues incase you encounter problems or bugs.
